set up a python http server, inject a website with the javascript keylog included and capture keystrokes, works only with localhost you have to change the const serverurl and host ur website for it to be global

upon executing the python script a keylog.txt file is going to be created thats going to store every single key stroke entered in the search bar.
open javascript.js in an editor to see the script that is injected into the website
test.html is a test website that successfuly implements this keylogger
simple please contribute
